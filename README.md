Android application that monitors temperature, humidity and CO using the DHT22 Y MQ-9 sensor. It is also capable of turning on and off a buzzer and a LED that simulate an alarm. It uses a [Firebase database](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es), which is not available anymore, so it will display the latest measurement it took before it was taken down.

# Requirements
Make sure you have Java and Android Studio.

# Running the code
To run the project you must open the folder using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), then you build the project and run it using that software, or you can build an APK.
